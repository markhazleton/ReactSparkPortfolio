# Feature Specification: Robust Theme Switcher

**Feature Branch**: `[001-robust-theme-switcher]`  
**Created**: 2026-04-13  
**Status**: Complete  
**Input**: User description: "enhance our light/dark mode to add more robust theme switcher, using Bootswatch v5.3; use the Bootswatch help page to find the easiest implementation method possible and integrate the API where possible; add a maintained BootstrapSpark default theme into the theme list; create a dedicated theme switcher that lets users select a theme and see how it changes the site; review existing HTML and CSS for Bootstrap and Bootswatch best-practice compliance."

## Rationale Summary

### Core Problem

BootstrapSpark currently offers only a binary light/dark preference, which limits the site's ability to showcase Bootstrap-based design flexibility, makes the product less visually exploratory, and does not provide a dedicated experience for browsing, previewing, and selecting themes.

### Decision Summary

BootstrapSpark will evolve from a simple mode toggle into a full theme-selection experience that presents the BootstrapSpark theme plus all available Bootswatch theme options, persists user preference across visits, and keeps the site visually consistent even when external theme catalog data is unavailable.

### Key Drivers

- BootstrapSpark is intended to demonstrate modern Bootstrap capabilities, so theme variety is part of the product value.
- The current two-state switch does not scale to a larger catalog of site themes.
- A dedicated theme-switching experience can improve discovery, personalization, and visual QA across the site.

### Source Inputs

- User request for a more robust theme switcher, external theme catalog integration, and a maintained BootstrapSpark default theme.
- Existing application behavior already persists a light/dark preference and applies site-wide theme state.
- Public Bootswatch catalog data exposes theme names, descriptions, previews, and thumbnails that can enrich selection and preview experiences.

### Tradeoffs Considered

- Keep the current light/dark toggle only: rejected because it does not satisfy the broader theme-catalog and preview goals.
- Offer theme selection without a dedicated browsing experience: rejected because it limits discovery and makes theme differences harder to evaluate.
- Replace BootstrapSpark styling completely with third-party themes only: rejected because the site needs a maintained first-party default identity.
- Selected: provide a first-party default theme plus every available Bootswatch theme within a dedicated, persistent selection experience.

### Architectural Impact

- Theme state expands from binary mode selection to a richer theme catalog and preference model.
- Site-wide UI surfaces must remain usable and visually coherent across all supported themes.
- The feature introduces an external catalog dependency for enrichment, but selection must remain resilient when that dependency is unavailable.

### Reviewer Guidance

Reviewers should focus on whether the feature keeps the product usable under every supported theme, preserves Bootstrap-first markup patterns, and defines graceful fallback behavior clearly enough to plan and test without ambiguity.

## Clarifications

### Session 2026-04-13

- Q: Should supported themes include the entire external catalog or a maintained subset? → A: BootstrapSpark plus all available Bootswatch themes will be selectable.
- Q: How should theme selection behave in the dedicated selector? → A: Choosing a theme applies it immediately and saves it as the active preference in the same action.
- Q: What remains available when external theme metadata cannot be loaded? → A: A locally maintained catalog of all officially supported themes remains fully usable without external enrichment.

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Select and Keep a Preferred Theme (Priority: P1)

As a visitor, I want to choose a site theme that matches my preference and have that choice persist across pages and future visits so the site feels personalized and consistent.

**Why this priority**: Persisted theme selection is the core user value. Without it, the feature becomes a novelty instead of a dependable part of the experience.

**Independent Test**: A user can select a non-default theme, navigate to multiple routes, refresh the browser, and return later to confirm the same theme remains active and the site remains readable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a first-time visitor opens the site, **When** the visitor selects a theme, **Then** the selected theme becomes active immediately across the current page.
2. **Given** a visitor has selected a theme, **When** the theme is applied, **Then** that same action also saves it as the active preference for later navigation and future visits.
3. **Given** a visitor has selected a theme, **When** the visitor moves to another page or reloads the site, **Then** the previously selected theme remains active without requiring re-selection.
4. **Given** a saved preference is unavailable or invalid, **When** the site loads, **Then** the site applies a safe default theme and still allows the visitor to make a new selection.
5. **Given** external theme metadata cannot be loaded, **When** the site initializes theme selection, **Then** the supported local catalog remains usable for selection, persistence, and route-to-route continuity.
6. **Given** a selected theme stylesheet fails to load, **When** the system detects the load failure, **Then** the site rolls back to the BootstrapSpark default theme without leaving the interface in a partially themed state.

### User Story 2 - Browse and Compare Themes Before Choosing (Priority: P2)

As a visitor exploring BootstrapSpark, I want a dedicated theme-switching experience with recognizable previews so I can compare themes and confidently choose one.

**Why this priority**: The dedicated selector is the differentiator that turns theme choice into a discoverable product feature rather than a buried control.

**Independent Test**: A user can open the dedicated theme-switcher experience, review available themes with descriptive cues, preview how the site responds, and choose a final theme without leaving the workflow confused.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor opens the theme-switching experience, **When** available themes are displayed, **Then** each theme shows enough identifying information for the visitor to understand how it differs from other options.
2. **Given** a visitor is reviewing themes, **When** the visitor selects a different theme, **Then** the site clearly reflects the new visual treatment without losing navigation or content context.
3. **Given** a visitor is viewing the available options, **When** the theme list is shown, **Then** BootstrapSpark plus every available Bootswatch theme is presented as a selectable choice.
4. **Given** BootstrapSpark's maintained default theme is available, **When** the visitor views the theme list, **Then** the BootstrapSpark theme appears alongside the supported external themes as a first-class option.
5. **Given** a visitor opens the theme selector on a mobile viewport, **When** the selector is used to browse and apply themes, **Then** the controls remain reachable without obscuring primary navigation or the active-theme status.

### User Story 3 - Experience Reliable Styling Across the Site (Priority: P3)

As a site owner or reviewer, I want the site's pages and components to remain design-system compliant and visually stable across supported themes so that the theme switcher improves the product without introducing broken layouts or unreadable states.

**Why this priority**: Theme variety has negative value if it exposes fragile markup, inaccessible contrast, or inconsistent component behavior.

**Independent Test**: A reviewer can traverse representative pages and component-heavy areas under multiple themes and confirm layout, navigation, spacing, states, and content readability remain acceptable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a supported theme is active, **When** a reviewer visits the primary routes and showcase pages, **Then** key navigation, content sections, forms, and cards remain readable and usable.
2. **Given** a theme introduces stronger visual contrast or different component accents, **When** standard interactive elements are used, **Then** active, hover, focus, and disabled states remain visually distinguishable.
3. **Given** the external theme catalog is unavailable, **When** the site loads the selector, **Then** the BootstrapSpark theme and any maintained fallback choices remain available so the experience is still functional.
4. **Given** a reviewer measures supported theme changes under normal local-development conditions, **When** a user activates a supported theme, **Then** the visual update completes within 1 second in at least 95% of validation runs.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a previously saved theme is no longer supported in the current catalog?
- What happens when the external theme catalog loads partially and some theme previews are missing?
- What happens when external theme metadata is completely unavailable and the selector must rely only on locally maintained supported-theme definitions?
- What happens when the selected theme stylesheet asset is missing, corrupt, or unavailable at runtime?
- How does the site behave when a high-contrast or dark theme is applied to content with custom backgrounds, badges, alerts, or cards?
- How does the selector behave on mobile when preview content and theme controls compete for limited space?
- How does the system recover when a user switches themes rapidly or leaves the dedicated selector during theme changes?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a dedicated theme-switching experience where users can browse, preview, and select from all supported site themes.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST continue to support a safe default theme experience for first-time visitors before any explicit theme selection is made.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST include a maintained BootstrapSpark default theme as a first-class selectable option within the same catalog as all other supported themes.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST present identifying information for each supported theme sufficient to distinguish one option from another during selection.
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to activate a theme and see the change reflected immediately in the site experience.
- **FR-006**: Theme selection MUST save the chosen theme as the active user preference in the same interaction that applies it.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST gracefully recover from missing, outdated, or invalid saved theme preferences by falling back to a supported default without breaking the site.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST remain functional when external theme-catalog enrichment data is unavailable by relying on a locally maintained catalog of all officially supported themes.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST preserve readability and usability for core navigation, content sections, forms, data displays, and status messaging across all supported themes.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST preserve clear interactive states for links, buttons, toggles, menus, and form controls across all supported themes.
- **FR-011**: The system MUST provide an accessible way to understand which theme is currently active and how to switch to a different one.
- **FR-012**: The system MUST support theme browsing and selection on mobile and desktop layouts without obscuring primary site navigation or main content.
- **FR-013**: The system MUST expose BootstrapSpark plus every available Bootswatch theme as selectable options while keeping the catalog locally owned for resilience, branding, and review.
- **FR-014**: The system MUST review and correct theme-related markup and styling patterns that conflict with established design-system best practices or cause visual regressions under supported themes.
- **FR-015**: The officially supported theme set MUST cover the BootstrapSpark theme, the primary user-facing routes, and the showcase/demo routes included in the review scope.
- **FR-016**: The system MUST detect supported-theme stylesheet load failures and recover automatically to the BootstrapSpark default theme with a user-safe status indication.
- **FR-017**: The system MUST validate external metadata outage handling, stylesheet failure rollback, and responsive selector behavior through automated or repeatable verification before release.
- **FR-018**: The system MUST capture evidence that supported theme changes satisfy the under-1-second update target defined in the success criteria.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Theme Option**: A supported visual style that users can select, including its display name, descriptive information, preview cues, support status, and whether it is first-party or externally sourced.
- **Theme Preference**: The visitor's current saved choice, including the active theme and the fallback behavior to use if that choice is no longer valid.
- **Theme Preview State**: The current presentation state shown immediately after a user selects a theme and before the user navigates elsewhere in the site.
- **Theme Support Matrix**: The product-owned record of which top-level routes, showcase/demo pages, component groups, and UI states must remain acceptable for each supported theme.

### Dependencies & Assumptions

- A locally maintained supported-theme catalog is the source of truth for selectable themes, while external theme metadata may enrich presentation when available.
- BootstrapSpark's maintained default theme remains the canonical fallback and branding baseline.
- Not every publicly available external theme must be treated as permanently supported if quality review shows incompatibilities.
- Bootstrap-compliance review covers the major user-facing routes, navigation, forms, content cards, alerts, dropdowns, and showcase/demo pages that represent the product's styling surface.

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of visitors can reach a theme-selection experience and activate a supported theme in 3 interactions or fewer from a global entry point.
- **SC-002**: 95% or more of tested theme changes apply visual updates within 1 second on a standard broadband connection.
- **SC-003**: 100% of tested page refreshes and cross-route navigations preserve the user's most recent valid theme selection.
- **SC-004**: 100% of supported themes pass manual review for readability and usable interactive states on the site's primary routes and showcase pages.
- **SC-005**: The dedicated theme-switching experience remains functional in 100% of tests when external theme-catalog enrichment is unavailable.
- **SC-006**: 100% of simulated stylesheet load failures recover to the BootstrapSpark default theme without leaving the app in a broken or partially themed state.
- **SC-007**: 100% of responsive validation runs confirm the selector remains usable on both mobile and desktop layouts without obscuring navigation or active-theme status.
