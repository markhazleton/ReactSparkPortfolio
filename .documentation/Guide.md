## How to Use DevSpark Commands

DevSpark commands are invoked via `/devspark.<command>` in Claude Code. Scripts live in `.devspark/scripts/bash/` (stock defaults) and `.documentation/scripts/` (team overrides). Command prompts live in `.devspark/defaults/commands/` (stock) and `.documentation/commands/` (team overrides).

| Command | Purpose | Script |
|---|---|---|
| `/devspark.specify` | Define requirements and user stories | — |
| `/devspark.plan` | Create implementation plan | `setup-plan.sh` |
| `/devspark.tasks` | Break plan into actionable tasks | — |
| `/devspark.implement` | Execute tasks | — |
| `/devspark.harvest` | Extract knowledge from completed docs, archive stale artifacts | `harvest.sh` |
| `/devspark.archive` | Move outdated docs to `.archive/`, update Guide.md and CHANGELOG.md | `archive-context.sh` |
| `/devspark.pr-review` | Constitution-aware PR review | `get-pr-context.sh` |
| `/devspark.quickfix` | Lightweight bug fix workflow | `quickfix-context.sh` |
| `/devspark.site-audit` | Audit documentation quality | `site-audit.sh` |
| `/devspark.release` | Review and prepare release artifacts, then pair with a pushed `vX.Y.Z` tag to publish a GitHub Release package | `release-context.sh` |

### Release Automation

`/devspark.release` is expected to produce the versioned release docs under `.documentation/releases/vX.Y.Z/`.
When that release commit is tagged and the tag is pushed, `.github/workflows/github-release.yml` builds the site and publishes a GitHub Release using those generated release notes and docs.

## Constitution Location

**`/.documentation/memory/constitution.md`** — The project constitution defines non-negotiable principles covering type safety, code quality, testing, documentation standards, component architecture, error handling, logging, security, styling, and deployment. All code reviews must verify compliance.

## What Is in `.archive/`

Completed and historical docs moved here by archive runs. **Do not read from here during normal operations.** Files are preserved for audit and traceability only. See `.archive/README.md` for the index of archive batches.
