  "about": "This app is designed to serve as both a demonstration and a reference implementation of how modern React development practices can be used to build dynamic, maintainable, and extensible web applications. ReactSpark consumes data and services from the existing .NET-powered WebSpark APIs, offering a seamless integration between frontend and backend technologies. While WebSpark's previous apps (like PromptSpark and AsyncSpark) demonstrate server-side capabilities, ReactSpark focuses on demonstrating real-time data binding, dynamic routing, showcasing React + Vite for rapid frontend development, and utilizing modern React libraries (e.g., React Router, TailwindCSS, and context/state management).",
